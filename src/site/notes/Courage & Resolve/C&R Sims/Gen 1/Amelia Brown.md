**Amelia Brown** is the protagonist of the first chapter of [[Courage & Resolve/Courage & Resolve\|Courage & Resolve]].

## Profile
> [!caption|right]
> ![B.1.8.2.png|100px](/img/user/Images/Story/B.1.8.2.png) 
> Amelia and Samson at The Dancing Crab.

Born and raised in [[Uncategorized/Towns/Brindleton Bay\|Brindleton Bay]], Amelia enjoyed an average childhood, and started working at [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Locations/Gen 1/The Dancing Crab\|The Dancing Crab]] while in her sophomore year of high school. She saved up enough to move out and put herself through school at the University of Brindleton. She worked there throughout her time in school, and it was at that restaurant where she met [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Samson Brown\|Samson Brown]]. The two become good friends, and later, they began dating and eventually wed.

> Amelia and Samson purchase their first home.

When Amelia got pregnant with [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Jamira Brown\|Jamira]], she and Samson discussed things, and he chose to drop out of college and put his tuition money towards a [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Locations/Gen 1/Amelia and Samson's\|house]]. Amelia was pursuing a law degree, while Samson was merely an aspiring musician, so they both agreed her degree was more valuable. This decision, however, later proved to be a point of contention that marked the deterioration of their marriage. Once Amelia gradated, she was unable to find work, so the two continued to do what they had, and after the birth of [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Cory Brown\|Cory]], money started to run out. Samson, angry at their situation, began drinking and became abusive. In response, Amelia began to put money away, and once she had enough, she took their children and left for a [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Locations/Gen 1/Brown Residence\|new home]] in [[Uncategorized/Towns/Willow Creek\|Willow Creek]].

Once in Willow Creek, Amelia was lucky enough to be job searching at the same time that [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Locations/Gen 1/Beauchamp Law\|Beauchamp Law]] was desperately seeking new employees. Once they saw her law degree, they hired her on the spot. At the company, Amelia was a rising star, and quickly became one of the top four employees, which attracted the ire of [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Stefan Barrens\|Stefan Barrens]], another employee who felt he was more deserving. Amelia tried to report Stefan, but her boss, [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Felix Beauchamp\|Felix Beauchamp]], refused to meet with her, having her speak to his wife and business partner [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Genevieve Beauchamp\|Genevieve]] instead. Left with no other options, Amelia recorded the things Stefan said to her and submitted them to a local news agency. This got Felix to meet with her, and ended up changing things at the company.

> Amelia cooks for Jamira and Cory.

While Amelia enjoyed success and vindication at Beauchamp Law, at home, she dedicated herself to being the greatest mother she could be for Jamira and Cory. She ensured their lives were comfortable, and in her free time, she enjoyed a close friendship with her neighbor, [[Dreams of Fame/DoF Sims/Gen 1/Jo Kauffman\|Jo Kauffman]]. Jo became someone Amelia could tell anything to, and Jo enjoyed listening to her. The pair of them could talk for hours about near anything, and Jo even looked after Jamira and Cory for her when she had the spare time.

> Amelia meets with Samson.

Things shifted rather abruptly for Amelia when Genevieve approached her at work and broke company policy to tell her that Samson had come to town, and was after custody of their children. While the warning helped lessen the shock, Amelia was still surprised when she received a letter from Samson telling her to meet him in a [[Dreams of Fame/DOF Locations/Gen 1/Magnolia Blossom\|park]]. He told her that all he wanted was to be a father to her children, and that he wanted to meet with them. Against her better judgement and the warnings of Jo and the Beauchamps, Amelia met with Samson, and he realized that his children would never see him a father.

> Samson threatens his family.

Falsely believing that the worst was over, Amelia went back to enjoying her life until she received the shocking news that Jo had been found dead. Convinced that her death was unnatural, Amelia would beg anyone who would listen to believe her and investigate her death as a murder, but no one listened. Badly shaken by Jo's passing, Amelia tried to enjoy the days that followed, but Jamira and Cory were too grown, Felix and Genevieve were busy, and she was left alone. While out supporting Felix's campaign one night, Amelia came home to find Samson with a gun, trying to take her children hostage. Their tense standoff was cut short when a car driven by [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Carter Reyes\|Carter Reyes]] struck him dead on, killing him instantly.

## Personality
Amelia is best described as someone who loves her family. She's fiercely defensive of both [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Jamira Brown\|Jamira]] and [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Cory Brown\|Cory]], and would do absolutely anything for them. She once held the same love for [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Samson Brown\|Samson]], and throughout her meetings with him after their divorce, she occasionally caught glimpses of the man she'd fallen in love with and it hurt her. Amelia hurt even more after Samson's passing, missing the man he'd been and the dream of a perfect family they'd once shared.

As someone who never really enjoyed confrontation, Amelia tends to keep her head down and bear bad situations, something that hurt her first with Samson and later with [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Stefan Barrens\|Stefan]]. She has her limits, however, and when pushed she's willing to take big swings with enough preparation. Socially, Amelia loves gossip, and the ability to talk for hours about anything without fear of judgement. The basis of her friendship with [[Dreams of Fame/DoF Sims/Gen 1/Jo Kauffman\|Jo]] was based on gossip before it developed into something much deeper.

## Trivia
- Amelia, alongside [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Jamira Brown\|Jamira]] and [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Cory Brown\|Cory]], were downloaded from the Sims 4 Gallery to fill a lot in a neighborhood. In that save, [[Courage & Resolve/C&R Sims/Gen 1/Carter Reyes\|Carter]] was the Sim I was playing with, but he bonded closely with the Brown family. This is what led to the Browns becoming the focus of their own story.
